The rooms were beautiful. The AC was good and quiet, which was key for us as outside it was 100F and our babywas getting uncomfortable because of the heat. The breakfast was good too with good options and good servicing times.
The thing we didn't like was that the toilet in our bathroom was smelly. It could have been that the toilet was broken before we arrived.
Either way it was very uncomfortable. Once we notified the staff, they came and cleaned it and left candles.
